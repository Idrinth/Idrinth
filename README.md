# Björn 'Idrinth' Büttner

I'm a developer sing github for most of my projects as you can see below.

I like coding, the language matters little to me, but somehow I end up with PHP quiet often.

If you want me to code something open source, feel free to open a [ticket](https://tickets.idrinth.de) or send a mail to ticket@idrinth.de - I'll certainly have a look if it could be a fun project!
